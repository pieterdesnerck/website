Graham, John, James and Iain gave the presentation above. We explained a little of the history of the organisation and how it came to be in its current form. After explaining why a residents association is particularly important for Eddington, the chair emphasised that we need more volunteers. This will allow us to keep up with the growing opportunities and teething pains of our neighbourhood as it continuously expands.

We were keen to emphasise that the ERA only does what it does because of the interests of those involved. The existing committee lacks diversity, and because of that it does not represent the full set of residents' interests. Anyone with a cause, event or initiative to champion should volunteer to do that thing as part of the ERA, and receive the support of the committee.

## What was discussed

[Tennis Courts](#tennis-courts){:name='tennis-courts'} were hoped for by many present. **We're looking for someone to champion this initiative** and can support them with access to Portal and the University's Development Office as they plan green spaces and sporting facilities for Phase 2.

[Allotments](#allotments){:name='allotments'} were hoped for by many present. They featured in outline plans for Phase 2 which are currently under re-application. Portal has talked about providing some kind of temporary communal gardening space in the shorter term to bridge the gap, though this is unlikely to be a full allotment system. **We're looking for a champion of this cause**.

[Architectural Drawings for freeholders](#drawings){:name='drawings'} had proved tricky for many residents to extract from the developer. The ERA expressed support for a group action but has no existing relationship with Hill Residential. Richard, a local architect, has offered to champion this issue.

[Involvement of neighbours in Key Worker Housing](#key-workers){:name='key-workers'} was a concern leading to some useful ideas. Suggestions of ERA-curated WhatsApp groups; block representatives and keeping a list of neighbourhood groups on the website were briefly discussed. **We're seeking input from any Key Workers** who have insight into how very-local groups are organised currently.

A number of other queries and ideas were raised, which you can find in [the full minutes](/meetings/minutes/agm/2024-04-11.pdf).

## Who was elected

The seven committee members stood for re-election without competition and duly re-elected. Everyone is welcome to stand for election, but you don't have to wait till next year to get involved. Becoming a champion of a local cause or volunteering to help at an event is a great first step. And after getting some experience you might consider joining the committee in future.

## What's next

A number of volunteers stepped up to support initiatives raised; to support future events; and to help run the ERA. We're grateful to all who want to do more - interested parties are invited to our next committee meeting. It's in mid-May - [let us know](contact-us) if you would like to come along.
